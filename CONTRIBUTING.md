# Contributing to Kria

Thank you for your interest in Kria. This document explains how to get set up, make changes, and open pull requests.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install a recent **stable Rust** toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
3. Build and run tests:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo build --release
./target/release/kria test.krx
```

4. Explore [`examples/`](examples/) to see language features in context.

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lexer.rs` | Tokenization |
| `src/parser.rs` | AST / syntax |
| `src/compiler.rs` | Bytecode generation |
| `src/vm.rs` | Runtime |
| `src/repl.rs` | Interactive REPL |
| `src/modules.rs` | Multi-file import graph |
| `src/project.rs` | Entry-file compile pipeline |
| `examples/` | Sample `.krx` programs |
| `benchmarks/` | Performance scripts and `.krx` benches |

Pipeline: **Lexer → Parser → Compiler → VM**. New syntax usually touches lexer, parser, and compiler; runtime behavior lives in `vm.rs`.

## Making changes

### Language / VM changes

- Keep diffs focused; one feature or fix per PR when possible.
- Add or update an example under `examples/` when behavior is user-visible.
- Run `cargo test` and at least `test.krx` plus any related example before submitting.
- If you change performance-sensitive paths, consider running `./benchmarks/benchmarks.sh` and noting results in the PR.

### Documentation

- Update **README.md** for user-facing behavior.
- Keep README concise; long tutorials belong in `examples/` or future docs.

### Code style

- Match existing Rust style in the repo (naming, module structure, error messages as `String` with clear text).
- Avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to your change.
- Prefer readable code over clever abstractions; comments only where intent is non-obvious.

## Pull requests

1. Create a branch from `main` (or the default branch) with a descriptive name, e.g. `feat/object-keys` or `fix/repl-import-error`.
2. Ensure the project builds and tests pass.
3. Describe **what** changed and **why** in the PR description.
4. Link any related issue if one exists.

Reviewers may ask for tests, examples, or README updates before merge.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- Kria version / commit (or `cargo build` output)
- OS and architecture
- Minimal `.krx` snippet or steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Feature requests

Kria is actively evolving (modules today, package manager later). For larger features, open an issue first to discuss design — especially syntax and backward compatibility.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive in issues, reviews, and discussions. We want contributions to be welcoming and technical.

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) as the project.
